# SRP OR Single Responsibility Principle

## Scenario:
Design an order management application for a restaurant.
## Details:

### The application should consist of classes that have specific tasks:
Manage orders (add, delete, edit orders).
Calculate taxes and final cost.
Send notifications to the customer about the order status.
The emphasis is on each class having only one task and that 
changes to one task do not affect other tasks.
